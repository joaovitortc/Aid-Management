  <h1>Aid Management Application</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Aid Management Application is an object-oriented disaster relief application developed in C++. It employs meticulous memory management, robust file handling, and data structures and algorithms to optimize resource allocation and streamline data organization. Key object-oriented features such as polymorphism and inheritance enhance flexibility and extensibility.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Unified Aid Management Interface with Polymorphism and Inheritance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilizes polymorphism for a common interface to handle various aid types, facilitating seamless integration of new aid categories.</li>
        <li>Implements inheritance to establish a hierarchy of aid items, allowing shared properties in a base class and customization in derived classes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Meticulous Memory Management:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manages memory dynamically for efficient allocation and deallocation.</li>
        <li>Ensures proper memory handling, preventing memory leaks and enhancing overall application stability.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Robust File Handling with Object-Oriented Abstraction:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Encapsulates file operations within classes to provide an abstraction for seamless import and export of aid-related data.</li>
        <li>Enhances maintainability and extensibility through a modular approach to file handling.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms for Resource Allocation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilizes data structures and algorithms for resource allocation and organization.</li>
        <li>Employs efficient sorting and searching techniques for aid items based on criteria such as urgency, location, and aid type.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
